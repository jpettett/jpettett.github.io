    <h1>Joseph Pettett</h1>
    <p>
      The way I approach my role as a software engineer is similar to how I
      approach my day to day life. I like to meet each day with curiosity,
      thoughtfulness and drive. Working as a wildland firefighter taught me to
      stay calm, think clearly and act decisively. My time spent in eCommerce
      instilled a passion for intelligent design, communication and creative
      problem solving. I am excited to continue utilizing my cumulative
      experience to solve more complex problems in the near future.
